# choochoo

A train timestable to add times and trains using Moment.js and hosted by Firebase.

Issues:
I can't seem to figure out this error message that I'm trying to connect my app to my Firebase. 

"firebase-auth.js:26 Uncaught e {code: "app/duplicate-app", message: "Firebase: Firebase App named '[DEFAULT]' already exists (app/duplicate-app).", name: "[DEFAULT]", stack: "[DEFAULT]: Firebase: Firebase App named '[DEFAULT]â€¦Estrada/Repositories/choochoo/assets/app.js:13:26"}"

I've watched the firebase youtube videos and they go into great heavy detail about using it and nothing about my issue.
